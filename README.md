javastar
========


JavAstar, or javA\*, provides a full implementation of the A\* search algorithm on an abstract level.

Everyone wanting to implement A\* for any purpose can use this package to work with. This project aims to be simple to use, hence promising optimal results and performance.

The correctness of the implementation has not yet been confirmed by a third party. Although, I believe the current implementation is correct and nearly optimal.

Of course, all suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to send me an e-mail or open an issue with problems or questions.
